# Rust Projects

1. Beginner projects which have extra instructions and links to similar projects so that you can follow along and build the projects

2. Intermediate projects for you to build and figure out for yourself (with the help of a few hints)

3. Advanced projects for you to do on your own, from scratch, with very limited instructions

Struggle is also part of learning.


Sidenote: Each project has a brief description along with a list of crates to help you make the project. If you want to challenge yourself, complete the "extra features" section to give yourself some more practice.

## Foundation Crates

* thiserror (Make custom error types)
* color-eyre (Report application errors)
* clap (Process command line arguments)
* serde (Serialize and de-serialize data structures)

# Beginner Rust Projects

#1. CLI Utilities

Rewriting existing tools in Rust can provide a great baseline to get started:

* echo: repeats input
* cat: concatenates files
* ls: lists directories
* find: locates files or directories
* grep: matches text in files

Other than the "foundation" crates listed at the beginning of this post, these projects don't need any extra crates.
